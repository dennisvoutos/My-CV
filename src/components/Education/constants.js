      "Graduated top of my class with a 4.0 GPA",
      "Gained valuable experience using Python and R for Data Science, built Machine Learning models and visualized data using R, Python and Tableu.",
      'Worked on an individual capstone project called “Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn: Enhancing Banking Retention Strategies through Data Science". I explored how ML algorithms could be leveraged to help us predict customer churn in a bank. SVMs, Naïve bayes classifier, Random Forest classification, Linear regression and custom neural network algorithms were used, and a final model with 94% accuracy was created',
      "I was part of a two-person group working on a capstone project with the title “Comprehensive Analysis of Brain Cancer Gene Expression Dataset for Early Detection and Classification”. Our team aimed to uncover the hidden mechanisms in our genes that promote the creation of 4 types of brain cancer. Leveraging a plethora of ML techniques, we concluded on a logistic regression model able to classify between 4 types of brain cancer with 96% accuracy.",
