The dataset used can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn/data Running the react app will give you in interface, and when submitting the data an API call is done to send that data to the python server, which in turn returns the prediction. The python server is done using flask.",
